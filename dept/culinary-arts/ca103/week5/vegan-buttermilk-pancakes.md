# Vegan Buttermilk Pancakes  
  
## Ingredients:  
- 1 cup plant-based milk (such as almond, soy, or oat)  
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or lemon juice  
- 1 cup all-purpose flour  
- 1 tablespoon sugar (or preferred sweetener)  
- 1 teaspoon baking powder  
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
- 1/4 teaspoon salt  
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil or melted coconut oil  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
  
## Instructions:  
  
1. In a small bowl, combine the plant-based milk and apple cider vinegar (or lemon juice) to create the vegan buttermilk. Stir and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it curdles.  
  
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  
  
3. Add the curdled vegan buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined; avoid over-mixing. Some lumps are okay.  
  
4. Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with oil if necessary.  
  
5. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface (about 2-3 minutes), then flip and cook for another 2 minutes until golden brown.  
  
6. Repeat with the remaining batter, adjusting heat as needed to prevent burning.  
  
7. Serve warm with your favorite toppings like fresh fruits, maple syrup, or vegan butter.  
  
Enjoy your fluffy vegan buttermilk pancakes!
