I had a bunch of carrots I needed to use up. So i chopped them up,
(and the greens too), added some garlic, parley, and thyme. As well as 
salt and olive oil.  Tossed it all in my dutch oven, brought it to a boil
and then simmered it for a couple of hours. 

Finally I poured it all through a strainer and jarred it.
