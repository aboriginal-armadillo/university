## **Instructions**

1. **Preparation of Ingredients:**
    - **Mise en Place:** Gather and wash all vegetables to remove any dirt or debris.
    - **Chopping Vegetables:** Cut vegetables into uniform pieces for better flavor extraction.

2. **Building Flavors:**

    - **Adding Remaining Vegetables:** Add all remaining vegetables to the pot.

3. **Simmering the Stock:**
    - **Adding Water:** Cover vegetables with cold water to start extraction.
    - **Heating:** Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, skimming off any foam that rises.
    - **Simmer Time:** Simmer uncovered for 1.5 to 2 hours for maximum flavor extraction.

4. **Straining and Storage:**

    - **Cooling:** Cool rapidly in an ice bath to prevent bacterial growth.
    - **Storing:** Store in airtight containers in the refrigerator or freeze.
