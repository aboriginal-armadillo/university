## Carrot Broth Stir Fry Sauce

### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup carrot broth
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free)
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce (optional, for sweetness)
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch (for thickening)
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon ginger, finely grated
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon chili flakes or 1 tablespoon chili sauce (optional for heat)
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar or maple syrup (optional for added sweetness)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the sauce**: In a small bowl, whisk together the carrot broth, soy sauce, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce (if using), and cornstarch until smooth. Set aside.

2. **Saut√© aromatics**: Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and chili flakes (if using). Stir-fry for about 1 minute until fragrant.

3. **Add the sauce**: Give the sauce mixture another stir to ensure the cornstarch is evenly mixed, then pour it into the skillet with the aromatics. Stir constantly as the sauce thickens, about 1-2 minutes.

4. **Combine with stir-fry**: Once the sauce is thickened, add it to your stir-fried vegetables, tofu, or protein of choice, tossing everything together to coat evenly.

5. **Serve**: Enjoy your stir fry over rice or noodles, garnished with sesame seeds and fresh herbs like cilantro or scallions.

### Notes:
- You can adjust the sweetness, saltiness, or spice levels by tweaking the amount of sugar, soy sauce, or chili.
- For a gluten-free option, use tamari instead of soy sauce.
