# **Recipe 2: Whole Grain Bread Baking**

## **Ingredients**

- **Whole Wheat Flour** – 3 cups
    - *High in fiber and natural starches; key for gluten development and dextrinization during baking.*
- **Warm Water** – 1 ½ cups (about 110°F)
    - *Provides hydration for gluten formation and yeast activity.*
- **Active Dry Yeast** – 2 ¼ teaspoons (1 packet)
    - *Facilitates fermentation and leavening.*
- **Honey or Maple Syrup** – 2 tablespoons
    - *Acts as food for yeast and contributes to the Maillard reaction during baking.*
- **Salt** – 1 ½ teaspoons
    - *Strengthens gluten network and enhances flavor.*
- **Olive Oil** – 2 tablespoons
    - *Adds fat, aiding in tenderness and flavor.*

## **Instructions**

1. **Preparation:**
    - **Mise en Place:** Gather all ingredients and tools needed for dough preparation.
    - **Activating Yeast:**
        - In a small bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and honey. Let sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.
        - *Key Topic Note:* This step ensures yeast viability; observing fermentation banner compounds such as CO2.

2. **Making the Dough:**
    - **Mixing:**
        - In a large mixing bowl, combine whole wheat flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in yeast mixture and olive oil.
        - Stir until a rough dough forms, then transfer to a lightly floured surface.
        - *Key Topic Note:* Hydration of flour initiates gluten network formation essential for trapping CO2 during fermentation.

    - **Kneading:**
        - Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
        - *Key Topic Note:* Kneading aligns gluten strands, enhancing strength; tactile observation helps understand dough development.

3. **First Rise:**
    - Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place (ideally 75°F) until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours.
    - *Key Topic Note:* Yeast fermentation produces ethanol and CO2, visualizing rising dough helps connect gas production with structure development.

4. **Shaping and Second Rise:**
    - Punch down the dough to deflate, shape into a loaf, and place it in a greased loaf pan. Allow to rise again until it crests above the pan.
    - *Key Topic Note:* Final proof allows for further gluten relaxation and structure setting.

5. **Baking:**
    - Preheat the oven to 375°F.
    - Bake for 30-35 minutes or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped and has a rich brown crust.
    - *Key Topic Note:* Dextrinization and Maillard reactions develop crust color and flavor. Whole grains contribute to fiber content, affecting texture and density.

6. **Cooling:**
    - Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
    - *Key Topic Note:* Cooling allows internal structure to set, preventing doughiness.

### **Learning Objectives Illustrated**
- **Gluten Development:** Must be noted during kneading and rising.
- **Starch Gelatinization:** Occurs within the dough as it bakes.
- **Dextrinization and Maillard Reaction:** Observed in crust browning.
- **Role of Fiber:** Whole grains exhibit differences in texture and density compared to refined flours.
