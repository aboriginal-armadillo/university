# Homemade Tofu Recipe  
  
Tofu is a versatile plant-based protein that can take on various textures and flavors. Making it from scratch offers insights into the coagulation process. Here's a step-by-step guide:  
  
## Ingredients  
- 2 cups dried soybeans  
- 1.5 teaspoons coagulant (nigari or lemon juice)  
- Water for soaking and cooking  
  
## Instructions  
1. **Soak the Soybeans:**  
   - Place soybeans in a large bowl, cover with water, and soak overnight (about 8-12 hours).  
  
2. **Blend and Strain:**  
   - Drain the soaked soybeans, add to a blender with 4 cups of fresh water, and blend until smooth.  
   - Pour through a nut milk bag or cheesecloth into a large pot to separate the soy milk from the pulp.  
  
3. **Cook Soy Milk:**  
   - Bring soy milk to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.  
  
4. **Coagulate the Soy Milk:**  
   - Dissolve the coagulant in a cup of warm water.  
   - Remove the milk from heat and gently stir in the coagulant solution.  
   - Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, allowing curds to form.  
  
5. **Press the Tofu:**  
   - Line a tofu mold or small container with cheesecloth.  
   - Gently transfer curds into the mold and fold over the cheesecloth.  
   - Place a weight on top to press out excess moisture for 15-20 minutes.  
  
6. **Final Steps:**  
   - Unwrap the tofu and submerge it in cold water to firm it up. It's now ready to cook!
