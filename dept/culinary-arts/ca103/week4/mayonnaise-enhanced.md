# Vegan Mayonnaise (Aquafaba-based)  
  
## Ingredients  
  
* 1/2 cup aquafaba (liquid from canned chickpeas)  
* 1/4 cup neutral-tasting oil (grapeseed or canola oil)  
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or lemon juice  
* 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional, for flavor)  
* Salt, to taste  
  
## Instructions  
  
1. **Emulsification Starts Here:** In a blender or food processor, combine aquafaba, vinegar/lemon juice, mustard (if using), and a pinch of salt. Blend until frothy.  
  
   *Annotation:* **Aquafaba** is used as a natural emulsifier in this plant-based recipe, taking advantage of its protein-rich composition, similar to egg whites, which assists in creating a stable emulsion. Incorporating mustard adds not only flavor but also acts as an additional emulsifying agent.  
  
2. **Slowly Add Oil:** With the blender running, slowly pour in the oil in a thin, steady stream. Continue blending until the mixture thickens and emulsifies.  
  
   *Annotation:* Using **neutral-tasting unsaturated oil** such as grapeseed or canola oil ensures that the flavor remains subtle, allowing the tanginess of the vinegar or lemon juice to shine through. This choice emphasizes the role of unsaturated fats in creating a light and smooth texture as discussed in [Types of Fats: Saturated vs. Unsaturated](#types-of-fats-saturated-vs-unsaturated). The slow addition ensures proper emulsification, a crucial step covered in [Emulsification Processes](#emulsification-processes).  
  
3. **Taste and Adjust:** Add more salt, vinegar, or lemon juice to taste.  
  
   *Annotation:* The **acidity** from vinegar or lemon juice is essential not only for flavor but also for maintaining the stability of the mayonnaise. These acids help to enhance preservative qualities and also prevent the mixture from breaking apart.

* **Types of Fats:** This recipe relies on **unsaturated fats** for stability and flavor neutrality. Choosing oils high in unsaturated fats like grapeseed or canola oil supports the emulsion and ensures a light, airy texture, highlighting the natural flavors of other ingredients.  
* **Emulsification Processes:** The presence of **aquafaba** and **mustard** validates the creation of an emulsion, which stabilizes the mix of oil and water without separation, essential for achieving a creamy and spreadable product.  
* **Role of Fats in Texture and Flavor:** The selected neutral oil plays a vital role in providing the desired **smooth texture** and enhancing the subtle flavors, illustrating the multifaceted roles fats play in culinary applications.
