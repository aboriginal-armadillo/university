# Emulsification Processes in Cooking  
  
Emulsification is the process of combining two or more liquids that don't normally mix, such as oil and water. This technique is vital in creating stable, consistent textures in many dishes, from sauces to baked goods.  
  
## What is Emulsification?  
  
* **Definition:** The stabilization of a mixture of two or more immiscible liquids, often with the aid of an emulsifier.  
* **Key Components:**  
	+ **Discontinuous Phase:** The liquid present in droplets (e.g., oil in mayonnaise).  
	+ **Continuous Phase:** The surrounding liquid (e.g., water or aquafaba in mayonnaise).  
	+ **Emulsifier:** A molecule that reduces surface tension, enabling the phases to mix.  
  
## Techniques for Achieving Emulsification  
  
* **Mechanical Emulsification:** Blending or whisking to break down droplets.  
* **Chemical Emulsification:** Using emulsifiers (like lecithin, mustard, or aquafaba) to stabilize the mixture.  
  
### Emulsification in Week 4 Recipes  
  
* **Vegan Mayonnaise (Aquafaba-based):** Aquafaba acts as a natural emulsifier, stabilizing the mixture of oil and water. Mechanical emulsification (blending) is also crucial for breaking down oil droplets and creating a smooth texture.  
* **Flaky Vegan Pie Crust:** While not an obvious example of emulsification, the combination of fats (which can separate upon cooling) with flour and water involves subtle emulsification processes. The goal is not to create a uniform mixture but to maintain a balance that contributes to the crust's flaky texture. The fat distribution within the dough can be seen as a form of emulsification, where the fat droplets are dispersed within the dough matrix.
