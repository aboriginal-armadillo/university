# Vegan Mayonnaise (Aquafaba-based)  
  
## Ingredients  
  
* 1/2 cup aquafaba (liquid from canned chickpeas)  
* 1/4 cup neutral-tasting oil (grapeseed or canola oil)  
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or lemon juice  
* 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional, for flavor)  
* Salt, to taste  
  
## Instructions  
  
1. **Emulsification Starts Here:** In a blender or food processor, combine aquafaba, vinegar/lemon juice, mustard (if using), and a pinch of salt. Blend until frothy.  
2. **Slowly Add Oil:** With the blender running, slowly pour in the oil in a thin, steady stream. Continue blending until the mixture thickens and emulsifies.  
3. **Taste and Adjust:** Add more salt, vinegar, or lemon juice to taste.

* **Types of Fats:** We're using **unsaturated fats** (grapeseed or canola oil) for their neutral flavor and to maintain the emulsion's stability, as discussed in [Types of Fats: Saturated vs. Unsaturated](#types-of-fats-saturated-vs-unsaturated).  
* **Emulsification Processes:** Aquafaba serves as our **emulsifier** here, enabling the mixture of oil and water to stabilize, a process explained in [Emulsification Processes](#emulsification-processes).  
* **Role of Fats in Texture and Flavor:** The oil chosen not only contributes to the **smooth texture** of the mayonnaise but also **amplifies flavors** of any added seasonings, showcasing the multifaceted role of fats as outlined in [The Multifaceted Role of Fats in Texture and Flavor](#the-multifaceted-role-of-fats-in-texture-and-flavor).
