# Flaky Vegan Pie Crust  
  
## Ingredients  
  
* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour  
* 1 teaspoon salt  
* 1 cup cold vegan shortening (saturated fat source), cut into small cubes  
* 1/4 cup cold unsalted vegan butter (unsaturated fat source), cut into small pieces  
* 1/4 cup ice-cold water  
  
## Instructions  
  
1. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** Whisk together flour and salt in a large bowl.  
2. **Cut in Fats:** Add cubed shortening and butter, using a pastry blender or your fingers to work them into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  
3. **Add Water:** Gradually pour in ice-cold water, stirring with a fork until the dough starts to come together.  
4. **Rest and Roll:** Let the dough rest, then roll it out to your desired thickness.
